                &emsp;- Add the remaining sidewalks for the residents who live along 1300 West. This has been a long-
                    awaited improvement which will provide safety for the children as they commute to and from
                    school. This will also provide peace of mind for all that walk and run along 1300 West.
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp;- Redwood Road corridor was released from UDOT after the Redwood Rd. expansion and thus far
                    nothing has been determined as to what is next for this area. I have spoken with residents that
                    live in this area and they are frustrated by the lack of progress. I would like to address these
                    concerns and adopt a plan to put action into motion.
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp;- Readdress the current taxation formulas for the police department. Our current taxation
                    formula was adopted from Unified Police Department when Riverton chose to start their own
                    police department. These practices are old and out of date.
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp;- Riverton does not currently have a recreation center for its residents, we should ask why? Most
                    of our neighboring cities have recreation centers. Riverton has grown to a degree that a
                    recreation center should already be in place. Letâ€™s work on this!
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp;- I promise to maintain an open line of communication with all residents who want to discuss
                    issues important to them. I will return all phone calls, text messages and emails timely and treat
                    each resident with the respect they deserve.
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp;- I promise to address these issue head on and I will always protect the residents of District Five.</span>
