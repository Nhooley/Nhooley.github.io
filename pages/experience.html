                        <span style="font-size:80%">I have lived in Riverton for 35 years. I raised my family here and have seen Riverton grow from a
                        small community with a single grocery store to the city it is today. Over the years, I have been very
                        involved in city issues including road expansion, water issues, public safety services and tax issues. I
                        want to work with the residents regarding proposed expansion of Trax on 12600 South, maintaining
                        open spaces for all residents to enjoy and control growth so Riverton maintains its small-town charm. I
                        understand and am mindful of residents property tax concerns and want Riverton to be affordable for
                        all those who call Riverton home. I want fair and equal treatment for all residents and will fight hard for
                        District 5.</span>

                            <span style="font-size:80%">&emsp;- Add the remaining sidewalks for the residents who live along 1300 West. This has been a long-
                                awaited improvement which will provide safety for the children as they commute to and from
                                school. This will also provide peace of mind for all that walk and run along 1300 West.

                                &emsp;- Redwood Road corridor was released from UDOT after the Redwood Rd. expansion and thus far
                                nothing has been determined as to what is next for this area. I have spoken with residents that
                                live in this area and they are frustrated by the lack of progress. I would like to address these
                                concerns and adopt a plan to put action into motion.
                                <br><br>
                                &emsp;- Readdress the current taxation formulas for the police department. Our current taxation
                                formula was adopted from Unified Police Department when Riverton chose to start their own
                                police department. These practices are old and out of date.
                                <br><br>
                                &emsp;- Riverton does not currently have a recreation center for its residents, we should ask why? Most
                                of our neighboring cities have recreation centers. Riverton has grown to a degree that a
                                recreation center should already be in place. Let’s work on this!
                                <br><br>
                                &emsp;- I promise to maintain an open line of communication with all residents who want to discuss
                                issues important to them. I will return all phone calls, text messages and emails timely and treat
                                each resident with the respect they deserve.
