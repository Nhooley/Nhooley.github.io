        <p class="declare">I am excited and proud to throw my hat in the ring by officially announcing my candidacy for Riverton City Council, district five. Having lived in and raised my family here for over 35 years, my family and I look forward to this challenge. I will run a positive campaign, one in which I will display integrity and honesty in all my interactions and treat all I encounter with the utmost respect.
            <br> <br>
            It will be a great privilege to serve my community on City Council. With over three decades of work experience with local government, I feel my experience makes me well suited for this opportunity. I will do so by listening openly to the concerns of all our community members with the goal of building a better Riverton, one that thrives economically and maintains that “small town” feel in our neighborhoods.
            <br> <br>
            We live in a great city! Let’s work together to make it an even better place to live, work and play!</p>
